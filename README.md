# Rpi Supervisor

Production-grade lifecycle, power, integrity and fleet management system for Raspberry Pi 3 / 4 / 5.

Rpi Supervisor provides:

- Safe hardware shutdown control
- Brownout detection and protection
- Read-only root enforcement
- Crash-only boot detection
- Watchdog heartbeat monitoring
- Secure device key rotation
- UDP node discovery
- Fleet dashboard aggregation
- Remote authenticated command execution
- Automatic Git-based update system with rollback protection

Designed for embedded, kiosk, infrastructure, and fleet deployments.

# ? Architecture Overview

Rpi Supervisor consists of two layers:

## 1?? Node Layer (Runs on each Pi)

Main daemon:
- `rsupd` ? Core supervisor process

Supporting components:
- `rsup-beacon` ? Secure UDP discovery beacon
- `rsup-node-api` ? Local status API (HTTP)
- `rsup-cmd-agent` ? Secure remote command agent
- `rsup-boot-health` ? Boot scoring system
- `rsup-crash-capture` ? Crash-only log capture
- `rsup-update` ? Safe Git-based auto-updater
- `rsup-key-rotate` ? Device key rotation
- `rsup-enable-ro-root` ? RO root enforcement
- `rsup-iofreeze` ? Pre-shutdown I/O freeze

---

## 2?? Fleet Layer (Central Server)

- `rsup-fleetd` ? Fleet collector daemon
- Web dashboard
- Per-device key trust database
- Remote command relay
- Key promotion engine

---

# ? Security Model

### Per-Device Keys

Each node has:
/etc/rpi-supervisor/device-key /etc/rpi-supervisor/device-key.next /var/lib/rpi-supervisor/key-epoch
Copy code

The fleet server stores:

```json
{
  "devices": {
    "pi-01": {
      "active_key": "HEX",
      "next_key": "HEX",
      "epoch": 3
    }
  }
}
Features:
HMAC signed beacons
HMAC signed remote commands
Replay protection
Timestamp skew enforcement
Automatic next-key promotion
Epoch tracking
No shared fleet secret required.
? Hardware Features
Latching shutdown switch
Momentary reset button
SAFE power-cut signal output
Brownout detection (vcgencmd)
Optional power-fail hold-up input
Boot glitch protection
? Node API
Default: http://localhost:8090
Endpoints:
Copy code

GET /health
GET /api/status
? Fleet Dashboard
Default: http://fleet-server:8088
Features:
Auto-discovery
Offline detection
Boot health scoring
Remote reboot/shutdown/update
Key rotation trigger
Fleet health summary bar
? Update System
Rpi Supervisor updates from Git:
Copy code

/etc/rpi-supervisor/update-channel
Example:
Copy code

main
beta
stable
Update flow:
Fetch origin
Fast-forward only merge
Restart service
Full health validation:
rsupd active
API responds 200
status endpoint valid JSON
beacon socket bound
watchdog heartbeat alive
config loads
If any fail ? automatic rollback
Safe for production deployments.
? Read-Only Root Support
Designed for RO-root systems.
Requirements during update:
Temporary RW mount
Git operations allowed
Runtime:
/run used for transient state
No persistent writes required
? Crash Detection
On shutdown:
clean-shutdown.flag written
On boot:
If missing ? crash detected
Crash capture runs
Boot health score reduced
? Boot Health Scoring
Tracks:
Clean shutdowns
Brownouts
Watchdog failures
Crash loops
Score returned via API and shown in dashboard.
? Installation (Node)
Bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/AirysDark/rpi-supervisor /opt/rpi-supervisor
sudo systemctl enable rsupd
sudo systemctl start rsupd
? Installation (Fleet)
Bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/AirysDark/rpi-supervisor-fleet /opt/rpi-supervisor-fleet
sudo systemctl enable rsup-fleetd
sudo systemctl start rsup-fleetd
